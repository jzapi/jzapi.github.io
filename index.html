        Visit my mockup idea concept in the following link <a href="images/mockup1.png">images/mockup1.png</a>.
        <p> I wanted to build a site in dedication to fizzy water and all its
          greatness. What's better than drinking water that's bubly, has flavor,
          yet has no calories? What's not to like?<br>
          <br>
          Let us not get confused with Sparkling Water w/Articifical Sweetners!
          That stuff has it's place but not what I'm talking about. I'm talking
          about plain carbonated water infused with flavor!</p>

        <h1>ABOUT SELTZER WATER</h1>
        
        <p>The drinks I talk about come in different names: Seltzer water,
          carbonated water, sparkling water, bubbly water, and other words. I
          wan tot make it clear that we are speaking about here does not include
          any drink that has sugar or artificial sweeteners. Everything is just
          carbonated or maybe with the hint of sodium, which helps stabilize or
          aid the carbonated water.</p>
        <p>Some of the current drinks I'm enjoying now are limited because
          I'm in Georgia at the time of this writing.<br>

          <img src="images/aha2.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          Do not be confused by my thumbs up. I'm merely indicating that it's a
          little better than the watermelon and cucumber flavor.</p>
        <p>Aha, by Coca-Cola is what I'm drinking now. They are ok, but for me
          the taste is a bit subtle and soft. I like the hard crisp bubbly
          taste. You can visit more of their options on <a href="https://www.drinkaha.com/">AHA's
            website</a>. If you had a choice between two Coca-Cola sparkling waters, choose Dasani over AHA. DASANI Sparkling water is a lot tasty, fizzier, and the almost taste like you are drinking the actual beverage flavor that it's trying ot mimic.</p>
        <p> Another choice I would consider, due to it's crisp seltzer
          carbonation is <a href="https://polarseltzer.com/">Polar Seltzer</a>.</p>
        <p>Why do I drink carbonated water oppose to regular drinks? Well of
          course I love the bubbly, but I do try to maintain my calorie intake
          for the day. My favorite calorie calculator is <a href="https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html">Calculator.net</a>.
          The website is simple and spares me any any of the extra over-talk stuff
          that other sites tend to want to post.</p>
