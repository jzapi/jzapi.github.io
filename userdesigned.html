      <h1>ABOUT MYSELF</h1>
        <p>I'm in the Army and I'm trying to achieve my bachelor's in computer
          programming from Southwestern College Kansas. I love all things
          computers, but at times I become a little tired of staring at a screen
          and just want to go outside and see the scenery or socialize with
          other folks. My hopes is to use the title of having a <i>bachelor's degree</i>
          as a potential for future promotions in the Army and my Civilian
          career.<p>
        <p>I'm a simpleton (simple person). I enjoy drinking fizzy drinks. In
          particular, I love to drink carbonated seltzer drinks. I try to
          maintain my weight, so carbonated water with infused flavors is all
          that I'm about to keep the cravings of having a sugary drink. I've
          drinken various brands of seltzer water and I will admit that I was
          very unimpressed by the named brands compared to lesser known brands.
          A warning to the future sparkling water drinkers, just because its
          made by the Coca-Cola factory doesn't mean that it taste all great. In
          fact, sometimes these big companies try too hard to over-flavor a
          bubbly drink to the point that it's just not satisfying.</p>

      I've created this website here as part of my HTML class. I hope you enjoy it and learn something during your visit.</p>

      
      <h1>THE RISE OF FIZZY FANCY WATER</h1>
      <p>It was the summer of 2011. I was back home after serving a few years in
        the US Army. I was visiting family and one of them handed me a brand
        name soda water. I tried it and I was hooked. Calorie free, sugar free,
        no crazy ingredients? I bought into the carbonated soda water craze and
        millions of others did too.<br>
        If you read into the many <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/08/10/542663727/seltzer-s-popularity-bubbles-up-in-the-u-s">articles
          available on the internet</a> you will see that the sparkling water
        phase is no fad, but is here to stay. </p><br>
